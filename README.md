[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Stvad/anki2roam/master?urlpath=voila/render/anki2roam.ipynb)

A tool that allows you to export your Anki deck into a Markdown or HTML page with the SRS metadata preserved
in the format that [Roam Toolkit](https://github.com/roam-unofficial/roam-toolkit) understands.

The development is supported by <a href="https://roam.garden/"> <img src="https://roam.garden/static/logo-2740b191a74245dc48ee30c68d5192aa.svg" height="50" /></a> - a service that allows you to publish your Roam notes as a beautiful static website (digital garden)

Example of the exported cards (first one Q&A card and second one is a Cloze card):
```
 -
  Composite Simpler Than the Sum of Its Parts
     The API of a composite object should not be more complicated than that of any of its components.   
     All objects in a system, except for primitive types built into the language, are composed of other objects. When composing objects into a new type, we want the new type to exhibit simpler behavior than all of its component parts considered together. The composite objectâ€™s API must hide the existence of its component parts and the interactions between them, and expose a simpler abstraction to its peers. Think of a mechanical clock: It has two or three hands for output and one pull-out wheel for input but packages up dozens of moving parts.

  It can be useful to create your own {{c1:TestCase subclass}} (with helpers, customized asserts, etc). This will allow you to avoid code duplication and make your tests more domain-specific.

## How to use it

### Web (recommended)

Go to  [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Stvad/anki2roam/master?urlpath=voila/render/anki2roam.ipynb)  and follow the instructions (it can take a bit to load the first time)

### CLI
#### Prerequisites

1. Clone the repository
1. Install Python and Pip
  - https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/
  - https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/
1. Install dependencies : `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

#### Running the command

```bash
usage: anki2roam.py [-h] [-o OUTPUT] deck_name profile_directory

positional arguments:
  deck_name             Deck Name
  profile_directory     The Anki profile directory

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Deck Name
```

**Example:** `python3 export.py "Software::OS X" "/Users/sitalov/Library/Application Support/Anki2/Stvad"`

## How it works

- If cards are **overdue** their review date would be set to the date of the export.
- Tags are exported and appended in the Wikilink format beside the SRS metada 
  (see Cloze card example above)
- Cloze occlusions preserve Anki syntax for them which by accident also works within Roam :) 
- Only cards directly in the deck are exported (ones from sub-decks are not included)

## Known issues
- The Cloze cards with multiple occlusions lead to duplicated entries in the export each one with the 
different set of SRS metadata
